## 1. Scope and purpose of the project

**This project aims to create an ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and load property sales data from the NSW Property 
Sales Information platform into a SQL database optimized for querying.** 

The database consists of two tables, one for 
houses and another for units, and provides streamlined access for future use through tools like Pandas. 

Ethical considerations 
include ensuring data privacy by anonymizing sensitive information, adhering to the platformâ€™s terms 
of use, and documenting the data source transparently to promote responsible data usage.


## 2. Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

## 3. Documentation of the database used and why (e.g. benefits of SQL or NoSQL for this project)

## 4. ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD

## 5. Summarising efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

## 6. References for the data source(s)

## 7. References for any code used that is not your own
